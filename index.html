        <p>A large number of people when they create portfolio sites like this, make overly complex and colorfull pages that, while looking great, they distract from the more importent content of the page. While I know how to style a webpage, I chose to make this one simplistic to avoid distraction from the projects and pictures I created and put on this page. <br/><br/>If you look at popular websites, such as Google, GitHub, and most internet forums, the background is never more then a dull color like slight tints or shades, blacks, or whites for this reason. It also makes use of more obvious colors much more effective at making things easy to find. This is why The navigation bar, titles and the banner image are the only parts of this website that are colored.
